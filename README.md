This project allows you to view Stocktwits, Twitter, Reddit posts, most mentioned stocks, stock charts, and bullish stock patterns all in one Streamlit app. I find this project really helpful when I'm trying to find out the market sentiment towards certain stocks or if I want to see a simple chart for a stock. It's quicker than having to open everything in separate tabs. While making this project, I learned how to use PostgreSQL, Docker, and TimescaleDB to get my database running, create tables, and populate them. I also learned and used Streamlit for the first time, which is a Python library for building clean and interactive web apps.

Currently, I'm having trouble deploying this project with Heroku, and I'm on the waitlist to try Streamlit's new sharing platform, which would be the most convenient method of deploying this Streamlit app. While I work on getting this app deployed, please watch my video demo. It demonstrates all parts of this project.
